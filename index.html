        <h3>The brief:</h3>
        <p>
            In this project, you will build a style guide/design system for your website. Developers and designers use design systems in order to organize the look and feel of a website or web application. Design systems help to document the visual vocabulary and reusable components of a large website.
<br>
As your websites grow larger and more complex, having a consistent set of styles will help them stay cohesive and enjoyable for users! It also helps as you start working with other developers, as you can have a consistent reference for how your website should be built.
<br>
Your style guide/design system will include at least a section on colors, fonts, and specific text styles, but it can be extended to as many other areas as you would like. You can take a look at our basic example site for a taste of what you will be building (yours will be customized).
